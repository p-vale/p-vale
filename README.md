Hello there! I’m Valentina.<br>
I’m interested in web development, ui/ux, and data visualization.

I’m currently learning: 
- python for data analysis and viz, 
- node.js to add the backend to my js skills
- advanced css to make the previous points pretty :sparkles:

I’m looking to collaborate on data journalism and open source projects.<br>
